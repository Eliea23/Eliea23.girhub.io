              <p>I have some dreams that I hope will come to fruition in the future. I want to live in a van. This sounds very wrong but trust be it's fun. It would be a converted van with a bed, shower, stove, toilet, basically just a house on wheels. With this I will be able to travel the world whenever I want to. Because of this, however, I will need to go to college for a job I can do remotely, which mught rule out Michigan, But we'll have to wait and see what the world has in store for me.</p>

              <p>I have recently started streaming on twitch and I hope to continue doing so. Streamig allows you to meet so many new people. I am petty social so i allways have a good time with it. I love playing games with my friends and hopefully making good content for the chat!</p>

              <p>I love talking to my friends. Getting different points of views on topics is so helpful to form a good opinion on a topic. Also my friends are the best people I know. I also firmly believe that having a good support group is vital to a healthy mind. Surrounding yourself with people who have your best interests in mund is the best way to do that. My friends motivate me every day to be the best version of my self.</p>

              <p>I have done Irish Dance for years. I can't remember a time when I didn't Irish Dance. I'm not saying that I am the best dancer ever. I am not. But Dance has taught me so many lessons. Before Dance I was shy but it brought me out of my shell. It taught me to take accountability and to reach out to others when I need help.</p>
